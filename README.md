## English Version

### 1. What is Clipo?

Clipo is a modern macOS clipboard manager built around a floating liquid-glass panel. It keeps copied text, links, images, files, rich text, tables, code snippets, and other clipboard records in one place, then lets you recall, search, paste, pin, organize, transfer, AirDrop, or process them with AI.

Unlike a traditional clipboard history list, Clipo is designed as a quick-access information hub. It can stay at the bottom of the screen, appear from an edge panel, or open near your mouse. It also supports multiple paste workflows, drag-and-drop file transfer, quick AirDrop, AI search, AI cleanup, and local storage management.

### 2. Core Features at a Glance

| Area | What Clipo Does |
|---|---|
| Clipboard Management | Automatically captures clipboard history and displays it as visual cards. |
| File Transfer Station | Temporarily stores copied or dragged files for quick access, pinning, dragging, and pasting. |
| Quick AirDrop | Send files, images, or selected clipboard records through AirDrop with fewer steps. |
| AI Extension | Search, summarize, edit, translate, clean, and process clipboard content using your own AI model endpoint. |
| Storage Management | Set cache limits, clear old records, and use AI to identify invalid or unnecessary records. |
| Privacy & Security | Clipboard data is stored locally; API keys are saved through encrypted storage; sensitive records can be encrypted. |
| Flexible Access | Open the panel by shortcut, screen edge, middle mouse button, or near-mouse mode. |
| Multiple Paste Methods | Paste normally, paste as plain text, merge paste, drag-and-drop paste, and middle-click paste. |

## 3. Clipboard Management

![Manage clipboard history](assets/06-history-search.png)

Clipo automatically monitors the macOS pasteboard and saves clipboard records as cards. Each card keeps useful context, including source app, copied time, content preview, type label, file size or character count, thumbnail, and app icon when available.

Supported record types include:

- Text, links, articles, code, tables, images, files, audio, video, 3D/model data, and general clipboard content.
- Rich text representations, plain text fallback, image thumbnails, original image data, and external file URLs.
- Source app information, timestamp, paste count, last pasted time, tags, and pinned status.

### 3.1 Visual Card Layout

Each clipboard item is shown as a card rather than a plain line of text. This makes it easier to distinguish screenshots, links, code, files, and text snippets at a glance.

A typical card can show:

- The source app, such as Chrome, WPS, Finder, or another app.
- Relative copy time, such as “Just now”, “2m ago”, or “24h ago”.
- A preview thumbnail for images and files.
- A category pill, such as Image, Link, Text, File, Code, Article, or Table.
- Size information, such as image size, file size, or text character count.
- Hover actions, delete button, pin menu, tag menu, encryption, AirDrop, and AI actions.

### 3.2 More History Window

The More History window gives you a full-screen style management view for all clipboard records. It is useful when you want to search deeply, browse large history collections, or manage many records at once.

You can use it to:

- Search clipboard records instantly.
- Search by category, app, content, time, or visual meaning.
- Filter by pinned items, tags, and record type.
- Review images and file cards in a larger grid.
- Delete unwanted records.
- Run AI-powered search for fuzzy or semantic queries.

### 3.3 Tags, Categories, and Similar Records

![Floating toolbar](assets/05-toolbar.png)

Clipo includes a floating toolbar for quick organization. You can filter by categories such as Code, Article, Table, Image, Link, Text, and File. You can also create tags and attach records to custom groups.

Useful organization tools include:

- **Auto categories**: Clipo classifies records into common clipboard types.
- **Tags**: Add custom tags for projects, clients, design references, or temporary tasks.
- **Pinned records**: Keep important items accessible for a set duration or forever.
- **Find Similar Records**: Locate clipboard items that are similar to a selected card.
- **Multi-select**: Select several cards for batch operations, deletion, merge paste, AI processing, or AirDrop.

---

## 4. File Transfer Station

Clipo is not only a clipboard history app. It also works as a temporary file transfer station.

You can copy or drag files into Clipo, then quickly reuse them later without searching Finder again. This is especially useful for screenshots, icons, PDFs, design assets, documents, downloaded files, and files that need to be sent to multiple apps.

### 4.1 Pin Files and Folders for Quick Access

![Pin files and organize toolbar](assets/05-toolbar.png)

Files can be pinned for temporary or permanent access. Available pin durations include short-term options such as 1 hour, 3 hours, 12 hours, one day, one week, and forever.

Use pinned files when you need to:

- Keep a file ready while switching between apps.
- Reuse the same attachment in multiple conversations.
- Keep project assets available during a working session.
- Prevent important records from being removed during cleanup.

### 4.2 Drag & Drop Paste

![Multiple paste methods](assets/08-paste-methods.png)

You can drag a file, image, or card from Clipo into another app. This is useful for apps that accept drag-and-drop upload or attachment workflows, such as chat tools, browsers, document editors, and AI upload boxes.

Typical workflow:

1. Open the Clipo panel.
2. Locate the file, image, or clipboard card.
3. Drag it into the target app.
4. Drop it into an upload area, document, chat box, or file field.

The app also supports drag-back cancellation, so you can cancel an accidental drag without changing your workflow.

### 4.3 Open in Finder and Open File

For file-based records, Clipo can open the file directly or reveal it in Finder. This makes it useful as a lightweight file launcher for recently copied or pinned items.

---

## 5. Quick AirDrop

![Quick AirDrop](assets/07-airdrop.png)

Clipo includes a quick AirDrop workflow for both clipboard records and external files.

You can AirDrop:

- A single clipboard item.
- Multiple selected records.
- Files dragged into the Clipo AirDrop area.
- Images or file records stored in history.
- Text content when a record can be shared as text.

### 5.1 How to Use Quick AirDrop

1. Open the Clipo panel.
2. Select or drag the item you want to send.
3. Drop it into the AirDrop target area, or choose AirDrop from the card action menu.
4. Select the nearby device in the macOS AirDrop sharing sheet.

This reduces the need to open Finder, locate a file, right-click, choose Share, then choose AirDrop manually.

### 5.2 AirDrop + Pin Drop Zone

Clipo’s external file utility area can expose two drop targets:

- **AirDrop**: Send the dragged file immediately through AirDrop.
- **Pin**: Store the dragged file in Clipo and pin it for quick reuse.

This turns the panel into a small transfer dock for daily file movement.

---

## 6. AI-Powered Clipboard Features

![Ask AI](assets/04-ai.png)

Clipo can connect to an OpenAI-compatible API endpoint. You can configure your own Base URL, API Key, and Model ID, then use AI to search, summarize, rewrite, translate, clean, or process clipboard records.

### 6.1 AI Search

AI search is useful when keyword search is not enough. You can ask natural-language questions such as:

- “Find the movie poster I copied yesterday.”
- “Show me the park plan image.”
- “Find links I copied today.”
- “Find the text about the architecture project.”
- “Search for the screenshot with a blue background.”

AI can search based on content relevance, semantic meaning, source app, copied time, and image descriptions when image indexing is enabled.

### 6.2 Ask AI About Clipboard Items

You can send one or multiple clipboard cards to the AI window and ask Clipo to process them.

Examples:

- Summarize a copied article.
- Rewrite a copied email professionally.
- Translate selected text.
- Format JSON or code snippets.
- Extract key points from notes.
- Compare several copied records.
- Generate a reply based on copied context.

### 6.3 Send Multiple Clipboard Items to AI

Clipo supports sending multiple selected items into the AI input area. This is useful when you want the model to combine information from several records, such as multiple quotes, screenshots, links, text fragments, or files.

### 6.4 AI Edit, Delete, and Clipboard Actions

Clipo can optionally allow AI to modify or delete clipboard records. This is controlled by a setting, so AI cannot change your history unless you enable that permission.

When enabled, AI can help with tasks such as:

- Delete specific records you ask it to remove.
- Modify text-based clipboard content.
- Show matching records as cards in the AI conversation.
- Clean up useless or duplicate content after your review.

### 6.5 AI Image Indexing

If your model supports vision, Clipo can generate image descriptions for image records. This makes visual clipboard history searchable by meaning instead of only by file name.

For example, you can search for:

- “the screenshot with a green map”
- “the blurry photo”
- “the blue icon image”
- “the La La Land poster”

---

## 7. Storage Space Management

![Storage management](assets/02-storage.png)

Clipo includes a storage page for controlling how much disk space clipboard history can use.

### 7.1 Cache Limit

You can set a maximum cache size. Available tiers include common limits such as 500 MB, 1 GB, 2 GB, 5 GB, and 10 GB.

When storage usage exceeds the selected limit, Clipo can remove older records until usage falls below the limit. Pinned records can be protected depending on the cleanup option you choose.

### 7.2 Clear All Records

You can clear all clipboard records and temporary drag files. Clipo can also keep pinned records if you choose to preserve them.

### 7.3 AI Cleanup

AI Cleanup helps identify records that may no longer be useful.

Available cleanup criteria include:

- Old records that have not been used recently.
- Scattered short text fragments.
- Life and personal information.
- Large files taking up storage space.
- Low-quality or blurry photos.
- Duplicate or very similar records.
- Custom cleanup requests.

Clipo filters results first, then lets you review the selected records before deletion.

---

## 8. Privacy, Local Data, and Encryption

![Privacy and encryption](assets/03-privacy.png)

Clipo is designed around local-first clipboard storage.

### 8.1 Local Storage

Clipboard history is stored locally on your Mac. The app keeps its history and cache under the app’s local application support area.

### 8.2 API Key Protection

Your AI API key is stored through encrypted keychain-based storage rather than plain UserDefaults. The AI settings page uses a secure input field for the key.

### 8.3 Encrypted Clipboard Records

Clipo supports encrypted records. You can encrypt a card manually, or configure sensitive apps so clipboard records from those apps are automatically locked.

Encrypted records can require macOS authentication, such as password or Touch ID, before they are unlocked.

### 8.4 Exclusions

You can exclude specific apps from clipboard history capture. You can also exclude apps from middle-click panel activation to avoid conflicts in apps where middle click has another purpose.

---

## 9. Multiple Paste Methods

![Multiple paste methods](assets/08-paste-methods.png)

Clipo supports different paste workflows so you can choose the fastest method for each situation.

### 9.1 Normal Paste

Select a card and paste it into the frontmost app. Depending on your settings, the primary card action can be copy or paste.

### 9.2 Double-Click or Enter Paste

You can configure what happens when you double-click a card or press Enter on a selected card. Common choices include paste, copy, or other card actions.

### 9.3 Paste as Plain Text

Use Paste as Plain Text to remove formatting and paste only clean text. This is useful when copying from websites, PDFs, emails, or documents with unwanted styling.

### 9.4 Merge Paste

In multi-select mode, select several records and paste them together. This is useful for combining text snippets, links, notes, or multiple copied fragments into one output.

### 9.5 Drag & Drop Paste

Drag images, files, and cards into compatible apps or upload areas.

### 9.6 Middle-Click Paste

The middle mouse button workflow lets you summon the panel, hover/select a card, and paste quickly without moving through a full window workflow.

---

## 10. Multiple Panel Opening Methods and Positions

![Panel positions](assets/09-panel-positions.png)

Clipo’s floating panel is designed to appear where it is most useful.

### 10.1 Panel Positions

Supported panel positions include:

- **Bottom**: A horizontal panel at the bottom of the screen.
- **Left edge**: A vertical panel along the left side.
- **Right edge**: A vertical panel along the right side.
- **Near mouse**: A quick-access layout near the pointer, especially useful with middle-click workflows.

### 10.2 Opening Methods

- **Middle mouse button**: Press or hold the middle mouse button to open a near-mouse panel.
- **Menu bar access**: Open settings, history, AI, and panel controls from the macOS menu bar icon.

### 10.3 Release-to-Close

Clipo can automatically close the panel when you release the shortcut key. This makes it feel like a quick command palette for clipboard actions.

When text input is active in the panel, the panel should stay open so you can finish typing. You can close it by pressing Esc, clicking outside, or pressing the shortcut again.

### 10.4 Remember Panel Mode

Clipo can remember the panel state and position after closing, so the next opening feels consistent with your last workflow.
